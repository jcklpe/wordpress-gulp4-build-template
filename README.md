# wordpress-gulp4-build-template

simple gulp 4 build template for wordpress. gulp 3 version previously used kept hitting security updates which forced an update to gulp 4. Having a simple build process was enough that I felt it warranted it's own repo to act as a template for new projects (even though I'm basically moving more towards webpack because of relying more on ES6 stuff)

Also has browsersync working which is great!
